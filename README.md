## Bourbon Documentation

All the following commands should be run on `master`

#### Initial Setup

```
bundle install
npm install
npm install -g gulp
```

#### Update the Theme

For local preview/theme development, run:

```
gulp
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000/latest`

#### Update the Docs

To update the docs, first update the version in the `package.json` to match the
one [here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon/blob/master/lib/bourbon/version.rb),
then run the following command to update the local Neat folder:

```
gulp update
```

To generate the updated the docs, run:

```
gulp build
```

To publish to `gh-pages`, run:

```
gulp deploy
```

Deploying does not commit your changes, so make sure you do so and push to
`master`.
